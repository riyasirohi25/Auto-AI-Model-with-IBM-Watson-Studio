# Auto-AI-Model-with-IBM-Watson-Studio
Built an ML model using IBM Watson Studio's AutoAI to predict Titanic passenger survival. The tool automated data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and tuning. Based on the Kaggle Titanic dataset, the project showcases end-to-end Auto ML workflow with minimal coding.
